# Eventer

### Welcome to Eventer, the event planning app!

#### Description:
Eventer is a Django-based event planning application, incorporating SQLite, Google Maps API, and Google Geocoding APIs for its functionality. Eventer allows for users to create accounts, host events, view upcoming events, and RSVP to events of their choice all through the application. Eventer also allows for users to send an email to the host of an event to ask questions or suggest ideas, as well as allowing hosts to contact every user attending their events whenever there has been a change in the event details.
